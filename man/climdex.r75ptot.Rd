\description{
This function computes the climdex index R75pTOT.
}
\details{
This function takes a climdexInput object as input and computes the climdex
index R75pTOT: the fraction of the sum of precipitation in days where daily precipitation exceeds the
75th percentile of daily precipitation in the base period.
